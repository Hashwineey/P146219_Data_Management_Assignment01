# STQD6324 Data Management: Assignment01

## Introduction
Hi and welcome to my repository!
In this project, we will be analyzing the Federal Student Loan Portfolio in the United States, using multiple open-source datasets released by the U.S. Department of Education.
These datasets cover various perspectives of the student loan landscape, including borrower age groups, repayment plans, loan types, geographic distribution, and overall debt size.
The primary goal of this project is to gain deeper insights into national student loan trends and uncover potential risk indicators that may affect loan repayment outcomes.

## Objectives 
The objectives of this project are:
1. To examine how student loan debt is distributed across different age groups and repayment plans.
2. To identify which U.S. states or territories carry the highest levels of student debt relative to population or debt size.
3. To investigate how repayment plan choices (e.g., Standard, Income-Based, Extended) influence debt accumulation or reduction.
4. To use basic pattern recognition to suggest where repayment failure or default might be more likely.
